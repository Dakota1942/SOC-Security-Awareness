                    <header> What is security awareness? </header>
                    <p> Security awareness is used in organizations to manage
                        the level of human risk. It's important to be aware
                        of threats and how they effect our university.
                        Human error could be as simple as someone 
                        clicking on a bad link in an email and entering
                        credentials. This could give a hacker the ability 
                        to gain access to sensitive information. Taking a 
                        little time to learn about security threats and how 
                        to look out for sketchy emails, bad websites, how to
                        create proper passwords, etc. are great ways to reduce
                        risk to our university. </p>

                <div class="sub2" id="sub2">
                    <header> Why does security awareness matter? </header>
                    <p> People in any type of organization, or in our case a 
                        university, should have some knowledge on how to 
                        reduce the possibility of creating an error. Whether
                        that is making sure your passwords are protected, using
                        a secure wifi signal, or knowing how to spot phishing
                        emails, they are all important. Knowing about
                        things such as that can help prevent people from 
                        getting the university's information, including the 
                        information of students, faculty, and staff. </p>

                <div class="sub3" id="sub3">
                    <header> Why should you care about security risks? </header>
                    <p> Being knowledgeable on security risks and threats is important
                        because it is not only the university's information and 
                        security that are at risk. Every student, faculty, and staff
                        member all have information stored within the university's 
                        networks. This includes full names, addresses, social security
                        numbers, etc. Also, several students and probably staff have their 
                        university account directly linked with their bank account. If any of 
                        this data were to be compromised, it could be exploited in multiple 
                        ways.

                <p> Knowing what good practices to employ in creating and protecting
                    passwords is extremely important for keeping safe/secure passwords. </p>
                <h1> Tips for creating and protecting passwords/passphrases: </h1>
                <ul>
                    <li> Use a phrase for your password instead of arbitrary words/characters. </li>
                    <li> Use unique passwords instead of repeatedly using the same one 
                        or slight variations of the same password such as:
                        Microsoft123 and Microsoft321. </li>
                    <li> Never share your passwords with others. </li>
                    <li> It is also important to periodically change your passwords
                        (The time frame depends on the level of security needed). </li>
                    <li> Password managers are also useful for keeping track of passwords. </li>
                </ul>

            <div class="phish" id="phish">
                <header> Phishing Emails </header>
                <p> Phishing emails are emails that are utilized by hackers
                    to try to attack or gain access to a system, or in our case the university's 
                    system. If you click on a link in a phishing email, 
                    it could lead to malware (bad software) being downloaded. The malware could 
                    allow hackers to gain access to our system and obtain personal
                    information such as full names and social security numbers. Another common 
                    way that attackers use links in phishing emails is by having the user
                    input their login information into a bad site that the 
                    link leads to. This could give them your credentials, which could also lead 
                    them to gaining access to the university's system and confidential information. </p>
                <h1> How to identify a phishing email: </h1>
                <ul>
                    <li> Uses bad grammar/punctuation. </li>
                    <li> Has a sense of urgency or will bring up consequences for not acting quickly. </li>
                    <li> Is from an unrecognizable sender. </li>
                    <li> Has suspicious links or attachments. </li>
                    <li> Asks you to input confidential information or your credentials/login information. </li>
                </ul>
                <h1> What to do if an email is suspicious? </h1>
                <ul>
                    <li> You should NOT click any links or reply to an email
                        if you believe or know that it is a phishing email.
                    </li>
                    <li> If you suspect an email is a phishing email, you should
                        report it to <a href="mailto:reportspam@usca.edu"> 
                        reportspam@usca.edu</a>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p> One thing you can do if you believe a link is suspicious is 
                    hover over it and the url will pop up without activating
                    the link. This is a good way to check to see if a link
                    seems valid or is suspicious. </p>
                <p> One example of a phishing email from USCA that contained a QR code. </p>

                <p> Another example of a phishing email from USCA. </p>
                <img src="img/phish2.png" alt="" id="phish2">
                <p></p>
                <p> Again, if you suspect/know an email is a phishing email do NOT 
                    click any links, scan QR codes, or respond to the email. Also, make sure to report
                    the email to <a href="mailto:reportspam@usca.edu"> reportspam@usca.edu</a>. </p>

                <Header> USC Aiken's VPN (Off-campus network) </Header>
                <p> Faculty, Staff, and Students should 
                    now use GlobalProtect for off-campus access 
                    to university network resources from their 
                    personal or campus-owned computers.
                    Using the VPN is a good way to access files securely off-campus. </p>
                <p> Instructions: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Go to <a href="https://pa-vpn.usca.edu/"> 
                        https://pa-vpn.usca.edu/</a> and login using
                        your school credentials Then download 
                        the correct agent for your system. 
                    
                        <p> (To know which agent to download if you have 
                            a Windows computer, go to Settings > System > 
                            About and find the system type to see the bit 
                            size (32 or 64) of your computer. For Mac computers,
                            go to the Apple menu and choose "About this
                            Mac". If it states that you have a Core Duo
                            Processor, then you have a 32 bit computer.
                            Otherwise if it says (Core 2 Duo, Xeon, i3, i5, i7), 
                            you have a 64-bit CPU.).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li> Once you install it, enter pa-vpn.usca.edu as
